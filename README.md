# Challenge-1-Code-Refactoring
## Description
This excersize was meant to show my skills in refactoring code in order to meet a certain set of standards.

- I reworked the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements.
- I adjusted HTLM semantic to CSS, made sure that all links are functioning correctly and met the requirements of web accessibility.
- I learned the basic structure of HTML and CSS and I am looking forward to expande my knowlegde.
